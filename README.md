Using MicroSoft PowerBi Interactive DashBoard for Business Analyst
Dear Everyone, I have just created a dashboard of a Madhav local store vendor such that the owner can track and analyze their online sales across India.
Project- key-points were : Data collection, cleaning, wrangling, modeling, visualization, Dashboard design, Sharing insights etc.
ï»¿Project Learnings: 
Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data
Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations
Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.)
Important note : AOV(average order value) is the amount spent each time a customer places an order , in this case we have got the total AOV by each and every customer.
